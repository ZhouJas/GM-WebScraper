# GM WebScraper
 This is a Python 3.9 Webscraper created to aid my internship data-entry work.
It autofills the provided template by mimicking the http request the car model customization page sends to the manufacturer's server,
thereby obtaining in response all required data for the cars and will create an output JSON with the required data.
